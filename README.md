I’m a Data Analyst & Data Engineer who helps teams turn raw, messy data into clean datasets, automated reports, and decision-ready dashboards.

What I can do for you

Data collection & integration (CSV/Excel/APIs/DB exports)

Data cleaning & validation (missing values, duplicates, outliers, formatting & consistency checks)

SQL analysis & reporting (joins, aggregations, KPI queries, performance-minded reporting)

ETL-ready pipelines using Python + SQL (repeatable workflows you can rerun anytime)

Dashboards & visualization (Power BI, Plotly Dash) with clear KPI storytelling

Insight reports (what happened, why it happened, and what to do next)

Tools
Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, Power BI, Plotly, Dash, Excel

What you’ll receive

Clean dataset + documentation (data dictionary if needed)

SQL/Python scripts (reproducible & well-structured)

Dashboard/report + short summary of insights and recommendations

If you share a sample of your data and your goals, I’ll recommend the best approach and deliver a clear plan from day one.
